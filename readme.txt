This project is an attempt at making a portfolio page for my work as a film director. 
The content on the page are all my own films, and potentially with some more refinement
this page could come in very handy. I went for a very drastic cyberpunk vibe because I love that kind of 
aesthetics. 

This page is supposed to be a brief showcase of the work I have done the past couple of years filtered by
commercials: (definition here is blurry)
content marketing films: (also blurry)
direct work (ie. films where I have written the script and concept)
agency work (ie. concepts developed by ad agencies and directed by me)
